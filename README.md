# system-threat-forecast

This project is part of the Kaggle competition aimed at predicting the probability of a system getting infected by various families of malware based on its telemetry data. The dataset consists of telemetry properties generated from system threat reports, collected by antivirus software. Our goal is to predict whether a system is at risk and, if so, the likelihood of it being infected by different types of malware.
